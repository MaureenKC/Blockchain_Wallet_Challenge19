# Blockchain_Wallet_Challenge19

## Assumed the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer in order to do the following:

### Step 1:
#### Import Ethereum Transaction Functions into the Fintech Finder Application

### Step 2: Sign and Execute a Payment Transaction

### Step 3: Inspect the Transaction


## Completed the following steps:

#### 1. From your terminal, navigate to the project folder that contains your `.env` file and the `fintech_finder.py` and `crypto_wallet.py` files.
#### Be sure to activate your Conda `dev` environment if it is not already active.

#### 2. To launch the Streamlit application,
#### type `streamlit run fintech_finder.py`.

#### 3. On the resulting webpage, select a candidate that you would like to hire
#### from the appropriate drop-down menu. Then, enter the number of hours that you
#### would like to hire them for. (Remember, you do not have a lot of ether in
#### your account, so you cannot hire them for long!)

#### 4 Click the Send Transaction button to sign and send the transaction with
#### your Ethereum account information. If the transaction is successfully
#### communicated to Ganache, validated, and added to a block,
#### a resulting transaction hash code will be written to the Streamlit
#### application sidebar.

#### 5. Navigated to the Ganache accounts tab and located your account (index 0).Took a screenshot of the address, balance, and transaction (TX) count.Save this screenshot to the README.md file of your GitHub repository for this Challenge assignment.
